# ksl-classified-scraper
KSL Classifieds Scraper is a simple screen scraper for KSL Classifieds that provides the search results in a friendly JSON format. At some point, I'd like to add the ability to provide additional filters like price, distance, category, etc.

Pull down the app, open with Visual Studio, use the following url to get JSON search results.

http://localhost:5000/api/search/help
